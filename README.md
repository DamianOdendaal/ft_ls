ft_ls - @42Born2Code

My own implementation of the famous Unix command: ls.

Running the program
First thing you are going to need to do is build the project by running make from there it's pretty simple, instead of calling ls, call ./ft_ls from the root directory of the source code after building it.

Supported flags

Long listing display: -l
Display recursively: -R
Display all files: -a

Sort by modification date: -t
Suppress owner: -g
Display one entry per line: -1(bonus)
